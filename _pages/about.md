I'm a senior undergraduate student at [Yonsei University](https://yonsei.ac.kr/sites/en_sc/index.do), majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I work as an AI Engineer at [Mediark](https://mediark.io/en), a medical AI startup, where I develop EMR automatic summarization systems, speech-to-text models, and medical test recommendation systems.

I also conduct undergraduate research at [MAI-LAB (Medical Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)](https://www.mai-lab.net/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dosik Hwang](https://ee.yonsei.ac.kr/faculty/member.do?mode=view&userId=BznU1ZzobN%2F2Jm7Jq5mLXg%3D%3D), focusing on Test-Time Adaptation for MRI reconstruction.
